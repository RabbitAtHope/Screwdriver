  <sup>â€¢ a collection of half-baked malware â€¢</sup>

Foundations for various nefarious programs in Python like ransomware, keyloggers and screenshotters, for use in tabletop simulations and blue team exercises to show in a controlled way what each type of malware might do to a computer. This code is deliberately very obvious, unobfuscated and unfinished to minimize the risk of malicious use and should be easily detected by most EDRs worth their salt. Much of this code is adapted from code from the book <i>Black Hat Python</i>.
