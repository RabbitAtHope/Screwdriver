  <sup>‚Ä¢ a collection of half-baked malware ‚Ä¢</sup>
  
  for use with: <b>tabletop exercises, attack simulations</b>

////

Foundations for various nefarious programs in Python like ransomware, keyloggers and screenshotters, for use in tabletop simulations and blue team exercises to show in a controlled way what each type of malware might do to a computer. This code is deliberately very obvious, unobfuscated and unfinished to minimize the risk of malicious use and should be easily detected by most EDRs worth their salt. Much of this code is adapted from code from the book <i>Black Hat Python</i>.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers
- Do not use these scripts for illegal activities. These scripts are intended for blue team testing and exercises only and are written in such a way that you have to really be trying to do something bad with them.
- Be careful not to accidentally encrypt yourself while messing with ransomware, even if it's extremely basic and easy to reverse ransomware like this one.
